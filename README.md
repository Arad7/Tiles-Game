# Tiles Game 

### About the Game
The Tiles Game is a puzzle game similar to the New York Times tile-matching game. The board consists of 6 rows and 5 columns, making up a total of 30 tiles. Each tile is made up of 3 rectangles, each colored randomly from a set of five colors. The tiles and their colors are randomly generated at the start of the game, ensuring a unique challenge every time.


## How to Play  
1. **Select Tiles**:  
   - Use your mouse to click on tiles.  
   - Select any **two tiles** that share common elements (same size and color of rectangles) to remove the shared elements and score **+1 point**.  

2. **Matching Rules**:  
   - If the two selected tiles **match**, the shared elements are removed, your score increases by **1**, and the **second tile** becomes the active tile.  
   - You must then select another tile that matches the active tile.  

3. **Mismatch Rules**:  
   - If the two selected tiles do **not match**, your score is reset to **0**, but your **high score** is saved.  

4. **Empty Tile**:  
   - If you finish a move on an empty tile, you can start from any tile on the board without losing your score.


## Winning the Game
To win, clear all the tiles on the board. If you remove all elements from all tiles, you finish the game and win! ðŸŽ‰
